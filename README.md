Hi there! 
I'm a queer Latino with a passion for technology and innovation. I recently graduated from university with a degree in computer science and am now working hard to build up my portfolio and resume.

As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I am dedicated to promoting diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. I believe that everyone deserves a seat at the table, regardless of their background or identity.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages and frameworks, as well as tinkering with hardware projects. I am always eager to learn and grow as a developer, and I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
